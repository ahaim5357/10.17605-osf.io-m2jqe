[*Expansion on Exploring Common Trends in Online Educational Experiments*][doi] contains the *50 Experiments+2022* dataset, providing additional information to the *50 Experiments-2021* dataset released with [*Exploring Common Trends in Online Educational Experiments*][odoi]. The expansion contains the raw problem logs associated with the provided experiments and raw student actions prior to the experiment period.

This project serves as a environment setup for integrating with both datasets by downloading them from their OSF projects ([original][oosf] and [expansion][doi]) and merging them into the same subfolder structure. This also downloads the accompanying documentation and licenses.

## License

The content of this Open Science Foundation project is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribute 4.0 International License][cl]. As the dataset is pulled from ASSISTments, this project is compliant under the [ASSISTments Public Data License v0.1][dl].

The software of this Open Science Foundation project is licensed under the [MIT License][sl]. This is to prevent distribution issues when using the source in other projects. You can read more about this [here][ccsoftware].

## Environment Setup Script

### Method 1: Docker

The [Docker Container][container] can be run using:

```bash
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app/env ahaim5357/10.17605-osf.io-m2jqe:mitcode2022
```

You can also clone this repository, then run the following [Docker][docker] commands:

```bash
docker build -t <image_name> .
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app/env <image_name>
```

Where `image_name` can be specified to whatever identifier the user desires.

This will automatically download the datasets, dataset documentation, and content/dataset license.

#### Environment Variables

There are three environment variables:

* `M2JQE_RAW_ZIP` (default false): When true, will download the raw project zip onto the local machine if it's not already present. The project will be pulled regardless for setup.
* `M2JQE_DOCS` (default true): When true, will download the dataset documentation and the content/dataset license.
* `M2JQE_MULTIPROCESS` (default false): When true, will execute the setup of the original and expansion dataset in two separate subprocesses.

These can be added to the docker script via `-e <ENV_VAR>=<VALUE>`:

```bash
# Download the raw zip, no docs, and setup using two separate subprocesses on the local machine
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app/data -e M2JQE_RAW_ZIP=true -e M2JQE_DOCS=false -e M2JQE_MULTIPROCESS=true <image_name>
```

### Method 2: Python Environment

The compiler script is written in Python 3.8.10. You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` provided:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> You may need to prefix the `pip` command with either `python -m` for Unix systems or `py -m` for Windows systems if `pip` was not properly installed onto the path.

Then navigate to the folder in your terminal and run `env_setup.py`.

For Unix Systems (Linux, MacOS):

```bash
python3 ./env_setup.py
```

For Windows Systems:

```pwsh
py ./env_setup.py
```

#### Command Line Arguments

There are four command line arguments that can be specified after the script:

* `-h`/`--help`: Prints the command and what arguments it can take.
* `-r`/`--raw-zip`: Downloads the raw project zip onto the local machine if it's not already present.
* `-n`/`--no-docs`: Will not download the supplemental documents with the environment setup.
* `-m`/`--multiprocess`: Will execute the setup of the original and expansion dataset in two separate subprocesses.

For Unix Systems (Linux, MacOS):

```bash
# Download the raw zip, no docs, and setup using two separate subprocesses on the local machine
python3 ./env_setup.py -r -n -m
```

For Windows Systems:

```pwsh
# Download the raw zip, no docs, and setup using two separate subprocesses on the local machine
py ./env_setup.py -r -n -m
```
